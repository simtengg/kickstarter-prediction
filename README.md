# About
Our team chose to analyse the variables behind the failure of Kickstarter Projects from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects?resource=download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kickstarter Projects Dataset (2018) </a>

# Problem Definition
How do different variables affect the failure of Kickstarter campaigns?

# Models Used
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. Gradient Boosting

# Conclusion
The variables that affect the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns are 
- name_length : short names 0-9 words long have higher chance of failure, some keywords are below

- usd_goal_real : goal amount > $10,000 tend to fail
- main_category : technology, publications, journalism and food are more prone to failure

# New Things We Learnt
- Handling special datasets like this: large, mostly categorical data, and the predictions are categorical
- Logistics Regression
- Using conda wordcloud package
- Random Forest (for optimization of decision tree model)
- Gradient Boosting
- Cross validation techniques to improve overall accuracy
- Collaborating on GitHub
